 - The internal help file will go here, I will list off the things that will not be deleted, how they impact the cleanup
process (if they do), and what remediation action IT staff can undertake to resolve it.
- Other things I want to do:
    - Redo the firewall rules function to use the Powershell cmdlets instead. This will futureproof this tool for Powershell Core
    - Create the internal helpfile and list off what things can be ignored, and what things need attention. This will improve tenfold when Benny's logging module is incorporated

What's new?
v0.5
- Initial test-build. This is a bludgen tool to uninstall sccm for now, still need to do some clean up work by using the tools the guide suggests, and restart the machine manually
v0.6
- Script calls upon ccmsetup \uninstall, waits, and kills process
- Script calls upon ccmclean
- Script calls upon .Net Framework 4.6.1 as per the instructions in confluence page
- Added some logic so functions only execute now when their parent tasks have finished
v0.6.1
- Removed most of the logic. Not happy with the reliability of the detection since the initial 4 services are seldom-enumerated. It is better to leave as-is.
    - That, but also checking if a process is not running is redundant to check. We kill the process as part of the start-up logic anyway, there is no need to check if its there. It is more worthwhile to retry if something fails, and then append a message to a log for an IT team member to investigate
V0.6.2
- Removed ccmclean.exe, and the .NET install in the "tools directory". More on this in the readme file

- Use an error variable to catch any errors, and present through a tidy errorview.
- If there is an error, it will display the Powershell-provided categoryview for the error. It would be something like "the path could not be deleted" along with a reason why.
# Along with that error message and path, there is a mention of consulting the help file for this script. In there, I will have documented a list of directories and files that will fail to delete in this script, and whether or not it is worth deleting them yourself.
- The use of the .Name member is used for legibility reasons. Not compulsary.

Author's Note:
#The condition that ForEach uses to create its list will throw an error if trying to enumerate registry keys that it does not have sufficient privilege to.
#This is due to a subtle difference in how registry hives are treated in Powershell as opposed to folder items, which you can.
#The logic in the loop will still work, but having it visible is not nice to look at.
#So I once again caught it with an error variable and had to set its catch outside the loop. Unfortunately, you cannot pass
#the error variable into the ForEach loop's catch as the logic being tested is outside the loop in the first place.
#Now back to the comments...!
- Enumerate the registry key and subkeys in the specified path for the ForEach loop
- Delete all items in the key/subkey path. The use of the .PSPath member is required for, once again, the quirks of Registry Hives in Powershell.
# When you query for a key, you are given the HKEY_#####_#### naming convention, and not the abbreviation. You could use a -replace parameter, but you're writing more code at that point. Using a
# PSPath however is a perfectly legimate parameter value when you're asking for the path to something. Unfortunately, registry keys like to be special and you can't use .path, or .name, to get anything useful
# out of it >:U
- Like in the deletefolder function, if an error is caught, it will advise what registry key failed to delete, and to consult the help file. In there will be the list of files that will require IT intervention.
